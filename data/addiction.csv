t3_fifu09,-ZeuS--,fkgwyvp,"Extract:      The schedule for Britain to negotiate its new relationship with the E.U. was already tight. With face-to-face talks on hold, it may be impossible. But Brexiters are already crying foul.      LONDON  As leaders on both sides of the English Channel batten down the hatches for the coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is coming under rising pressure to ask the European Union for an extension in its negotiations to reach a trade agreement  in effect, putting off the next stage of Brexit until the virus exits.      Under the terms of its withdrawal agreement with Brussels, Britain legally left the European Union on Jan. 31, but it is now in a transition period that preserves most of the old relationship, and has until Dec. 31 to strike a new deal. European officials, and many in Britain, have already said that timetable was hopelessly compressed.      Now, with face-to-face negotiations on hold, analysts said Mr. Johnson should invoke his right to request an extension so that governments on both sides can concentrate on managing the response to the virus and mitigating the economic shock that is almost certain to follow it.      Its going to be awfully difficult for the government to focus on this while dealing with the virus and maybe a financial crisis, too, said David Henig, a former British trade negotiator. We are already being overtaken by events, and I think that pressure is going to start to become pretty intense.   A spokesman for Mr. Johnson said on Friday that Britain had no plans to ask for an extension and that there were ways to conduct the negotiations even during the peak of the outbreak. Most of the substantive talks are not expected to happen until the fall anyway, and in the meantime, officials are discussing options for video conferencing links.      The opening round of negotiations took place in Brussels this month and served mainly to underscore the deep differences between the two sides. Negotiators called off a plan to meet in person in London next week.      Mr. Johnson has made getting Brexit done a fulcrum of his agenda. He has brushed aside those who say that hashing out a comprehensive agreement with Britains largest trading partner in 10 months is infeasible under the best of circumstances, let alone during a dire public health emergency.      But the rapid spread of the virus is already forcing the British government to reconsider its restrained response in other respects. After declining to follow other European countries in banning large public gatherings or closing schools, Britain is now considering both steps. Mr. Johnson had already postponed local elections, scheduled for May, until next year.      In a rational world, the U.K. would ask for an extension in June even if coronavirus wasnt happening, said John Springford, the deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based think tank.      The pandemic makes it even more pressing, Mr. Springford said, because the British state will not have the personnel needed to enact the sweeping changes necessary to leave the single market.      Britain must design and implement new customs and immigration systems; draft regulations on transportation, aviation and food safety; and begin negotiating individual trade deals with the United States, Australia, and many other countries. Analysts estimate that by itself, the additional workload from Brexit has necessitated adding 27,500 government jobs.      In January, when few leaders in the West had begun focusing on the coronavirus, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, urged Mr. Johnson to consider requesting an extension. Under the terms of the agreement, the prime minister must decide whether to do so by June.      Were other international trade negotiations to be put back because of the virus  for example those being conducted between London and Washington  Britains government could start to look obdurate about the Brexit talks.      Though video conferences can substitute for many face-to-face meetings, the Brexit talks are complex, ranging over an array of issues, from fisheries to finance, and involving a British negotiating team of 100 officials. Given the grim arithmetic of the pandemic, several of those negotiators are likely to fall ill.   It would be better to agree a delay now, Mr. Henig said. If June is the peak of the virus and it is also the point where we are going to say, no further extension, then that starts to look like a lack of forward planning.      Analysts noted that coronavirus could give Mr. Johnson political cover to ask for an extension, if that was what he wanted to do anyway. Last fall, the prime minister cited a law passed by Parliament as giving him no choice but to ask for the withdrawal deadline to be moved from October to January.      For Mr. Johnson, however, such a move poses a dilemma. Under the terms of its agreement, Britain would be required to pay billions of pounds to the European Union if it continued to have access to the single market and customs union beyond the transition period that ends in December.      That would be an acute embarrassment for Mr. Johnson, damaging him particularly with the hard-line Brexit wing of his Conservative Party. Pro-Brexit forces have already begun campaigning against a delay  suggesting, in a strategy that echoes some defenders of President Trump in the United States, that these calls were part of an effort to exaggerate and politicize the virus for partisan ends.      The same people who wanted to stop Brexit now want to extend the Transition Period, ostensibly over Coronavirus, said the Bruges Group, a Euroskeptic research institute, on Twitter. We know the pattern: Any excuse is found, one delay turns into another and Britain ends up in political purgatory. Brexiteers wont fall for this.      But there are significant risks if Mr. Johnson forges on with the talks to the current deadline. A failure to strike a deal with the European Union could throttle the economy because of the disruption of cross-channel trade. That would come on top of the shock from the virus, which has already upended British life, forcing Queen Elizabeth II to cancel her schedule and the Premiere League to scrub its soccer matches.   On Wednesday, Mr. Johnsons government said it would inject 30 billion pounds, or $37 billion, into the economy to cushion it from the impact of the virus. The Bank of England cut interest rates to stabilize the situation.

But Brexiters are already crying foul.      LONDON  As leaders on both sides of the English Channel batten down the hatches for the coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is coming under rising pressure to ask the European Union for an extension in its negotiations to reach a trade agreement  in effect, putting off the next stage of Brexit until the virus exits.      Under the terms of its withdrawal agreement with Brussels, Britain legally left the European Union on Jan. 31, but it is now in a transition period that preserves most of the old relationship, and has until Dec. 31 to strike a new deal. European officials, and many in Britain, have already said that timetable was hopelessly compressed.      Now, with face-to-face negotiations on hold, analysts said Mr. Johnson should invoke his right to request an extension so that governments on both sides can concentrate on managing the response to the virus and mitigating the economic shock that is almost certain to follow it.      Its going to be awfully difficult for the government to focus on this while dealing with the virus and maybe a financial crisis, too, said David Henig, a former British trade negotiator. We are already being overtaken by events, and I think that pressure is going to start to become pretty intense.   A spokesman for Mr. Johnson said on Friday that Britain had no plans to ask for an extension and that there were ways to conduct the negotiations even during the peak of the outbreak. Most of the substantive talks are not expected to happen until the fall anyway, and in the meantime, officials are discussing options for video conferencing links.      The opening round of negotiations took place in Brussels this month and served mainly to underscore the deep differences between the two sides. Negotiators called off a plan to meet in person in London next week.      Mr. Johnson has made getting Brexit done a fulcrum of his agenda. He has brushed aside those who say that hashing out a comprehensive agreement with Britains largest trading partner in 10 months is infeasible under the best of circumstances, let alone during a dire public health emergency.      But the rapid spread of the virus is already forcing the British government to reconsider its restrained response in other respects. After declining to follow other European countries in banning large public gatherings or closing schools, Britain is now considering both steps. Mr. Johnson had already postponed local elections, scheduled for May, until next year.      In a rational world, the U.K. would ask for an extension in June even if coronavirus wasnt happening, said John Springford, the deputy director of the Center for European Reform, a London-based think tank.      The pandemic makes it even more pressing, Mr. Springford said, because the British state will not have the personnel needed to enact the sweeping changes necessary to leave the single market.      Britain must design and implement new customs and immigration systems; draft regulations on transportation, aviation and food safety; and begin negotiating individual trade deals with the United States, Australia, and many other countries. Analysts estimate that by itself, the additional workload from Brexit has necessitated adding 27,500 government jobs.      In January, when few leaders in the West had begun focusing on the coronavirus, the president of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, urged Mr. Johnson to consider requesting an extension. Under the terms of the agreement, the prime minister must decide whether to do so by June.      Were other international trade negotiations to be put back because of the virus  for example those being conducted between London and Washington  Britains government could start to look obdurate about the Brexit talks.      Though video conferences can substitute for many face-to-face meetings, the Brexit talks are complex, ranging over an array of issues, from fisheries to finance, and involving a British negotiating team of 100 officials. Given the grim arithmetic of the pandemic, several of those negotiators are likely to fall ill.   It would be better to agree a delay now, Mr. Henig said. If June is the peak of the virus and it is also the point where we are going to say, no further extension, then that starts to look like a lack of forward planning.      Analysts noted that coronavirus could give Mr. Johnson political cover to ask for an extension, if that was what he wanted to do anyway. Last fall, the prime minister cited a law passed by Parliament as giving him no choice but to ask for the withdrawal deadline to be moved from October to January.      For Mr. Johnson, however, such a move poses a dilemma. Under the terms of its agreement, Britain would be required to pay billions of pounds to the European Union if it continued to have access to the single market and customs union beyond the transition period that ends in December.      That would be an acute embarrassment for Mr. Johnson, damaging him particularly with the hard-line Brexit wing of his Conservative Party. Pro-Brexit forces have already begun campaigning against a delay  suggesting, in a strategy that echoes some defenders of President Trump in the United States, that these calls were part of an effort to exaggerate and politicize the virus for partisan ends.      The same people who wanted to stop Brexit now want to extend the Transition Period, ostensibly over Coronavirus, said the Bruges Group, a Euroskeptic research institute, on Twitter. We know the pattern: Any excuse is found, one delay turns into another and Britain ends up in political purgatory. Brexiteers wont fall for this.      But there are significant risks if Mr. Johnson forges on with the talks to the current deadline. A failure to strike a deal with the European Union could throttle the economy because of the disruption of cross-channel trade. That would come on top of the shock from the virus, which has already upended British life, forcing Queen Elizabeth II to cancel her schedule and the Premiere League to scrub its soccer matches.   On Wednesday, Mr. Johnsons government said it would inject 30 billion pounds, or $37 billion, into the economy to cushion it from the impact of the virus. The Bank of England cut interest rates to stabilize the situation.      One solution might be to propose a shorter extension than the one or two years so far envisioned  a period of three or six months, for example.

The last time the world seized with panic over an economic catastrophe, those given the job of limiting the damage knew what to do. The global financial crisis of 2008 presented a textbook case of what happens when people lose faith in the banking system all at once. World leaders could rely on lessons gleaned from history to forge a plan: They flooded the markets with money and waited for calm to return.      But this time, as economic overseers confront a pandemic that has sent stock markets hurtling downward while provoking talk of a global recession, their tools appear impotent. The disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail. Yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.      In many ways its far worse than 2008, said Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate economist. There was a sense that 2008 was a show that we had seen before  the panic of 1907, the Great Depression. We know about financial crises. We knew that it was just money, and that one way or the other the government would step in and save the bankers from their folly.      This time, Mr. Stiglitz added, the cause of the emergency is not bankers and their exotic and dangerous creations but the natural sphere  a less predictable realm. The fundamental threat to the global economy is the spread of the coronavirus. Yet the means of containing its spread entail worsening the economic pain by keeping workers home, limiting travel and disrupting commerce.   This is playing out as corporations are bearing historic levels of debt. A profound economic downturn could trigger a cascade of defaults. That could prompt creditors to pull back on lending, starving economies of capital.      Central banks appear largely ineffective in the face of this reality, while governments have been slow to deliver public money. Not least, investors fear a leadership vacuum. A global pandemic is unfolding, threatening life and livelihood on six continents, just as the world is roiled by an upsurge in nationalism, protectionism and a pushback to globalization. That appears to be hampering the response, reinforcing borders rather than inspiring coordinated action across them.      A sense of powerlessness is feeding the fear that is prompting investors to dump anything risky, which is in turn damaging economic prospects and reinforcing fear  a feedback loop.      This is a shock arising out of the real economy, out of the real world, out of biology, not out of financial shenanigans or complexities, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. We are much less well suited to deal with this.      On Friday, world leaders were readying measures aimed at dispelling that impression. In Washington, the Trump administration and Congress neared agreement on a spending package to help workers and companies harmed by the pandemic. In Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would set aside its longstanding aversion to debt while spending as needed to preserve public health and protect businesses.      But those actions  while a potentially crucial source of relief for people and businesses  cannot snuff out the basic threat to the world economy. Only the containment of the pandemic can achieve that. And that objective unavoidably involves worsening the economic straits in the immediate term.      Much as in 2008, markets have been plunging because investors have grown terrified of every variable as imaginations run toward dark places. In normal times, markets process gradations of risk, pricing stocks and bonds according to the probability that something bad could transpire. In times of panic, markets avoid all risk as existential.      That psychology was so fierce in 2008 that nearly every market threatened to break down. The world is nowhere near that level of panic now, even as stock markets dropped further on Thursday than any day during the global financial crisis.      But some elements appear more perilous.      Investors grasp that the traditional crisis response  central banks dropping interest rates  is effectively inoperative. Rates are already so low in the United States, and negative in Europe and Japan, that pushing them lower yields scant benefits. Cheaper credit does not bring workers back to factories or shoppers back to malls so long as the virus remains a threat.      As the U.S. Federal Reserve, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank have intervened with emergency measures, each has precipitated a fresh plunge in stock markets. The central banks sought to boost confidence by demonstrating their resolve. But markets divined a different message: The world was on fire, and the fire department was out of water.   For years, economists have been saying that governments need to wean themselves of their reliance on central banks to spur economic growth, while spending their own money.      Britain responded this week, unveiling a budget that included 30 billion pounds (about $38 billion) to address the pandemic. Italy has outlined plans to spend 25 billion euros (about $28 billion). The United States has so far found only $8.3 billion, though more is apparently on the way.      Europe has a history of crippling recriminations in the face of crisis. Within the 19 countries that share the euro currency, Germany has effectively stymied calls for more generous public spending, posing doubts about the follow-through on Ms. Merkels muscular promises.      China, the worst-hit country, is a much larger part of the world economy than a decade ago, yet increasingly limited by worries about its own mounting debts.      The most profound alarm may be the perception that the overseers of policy are not adequately committed to the challenge, especially the leader of the worlds largest economy, the United States.      President Trump initially portrayed the outbreak as a hoax perpetrated by his political enemies to damage him. His speech to the nation on Wednesday evening  during which he blamed a foreign virus for the pandemic and announced a severing of flights between the United States and Europe  resonated as a sign that he was managing the optics of the crisis rather than the crisis itself.      The markets have been yearning for evidence that higher powers will deploy unrestrained resources toward relief. What they have seen time and again is that the people in charge lack the appropriate resources for the job, or are unwilling to use them.      Economic historians may debate for centuries how policymakers in the United States and Europe responded to the global financial crisis  whether they were too generous to the bankers and too parsimonious to ordinary people; whether financial interests captured the regulators. But most take as a given that the governments in charge mounted a sincere effort to set things right  a stark contrast to the mood now.      The fact that financial markets went markedly into shock, Mr. Posen said, has to be attributed to a lack of confidence in policies and leadership. Its a failure of worldview. Bush and Obama believed in reality.      Conventional wisdom holds that the pandemic will be confined to the economic sphere, damaging livelihoods but falling short of triggering a financial crisis. The banks are in far stronger shape now, the logic goes, having been forced by chastened regulators to set aside reserves.      The crisis of 2008 forced economic policymakers to grapple with the interconnection of financial players around the world. The masters of money had taken mortgages and packaged them into exotic combinations, selling them to institutions that used them as collateral against other investments.      Only after home prices declined did the markets grasp the extent of the interlinkage. The assets were hard to value, and the liabilities were hidden in a tangle of unorthodox contracts. The markets froze in bewilderment and fright.      This time, the forces of decline are more conventional, limiting the scope for panic. Airlines are suffering along with hotels, cruise ships, and oil and gas companies. That is hurting stock prices and challenging their ability to pay back debts. But even if they go bust, markets will still function, with prices adjusting to the new realities.

t3_fi4a29,-ZeuS--,fkf06jw,"Extract:       Ineffective monetary policy, scant action from governments, and fear of a leadership void is raising alarm about the pandemics economic shock.      The last time the world seized with panic over an economic catastrophe, those given the job of limiting the damage knew what to do. The global financial crisis of 2008 presented a textbook case of what happens when people lose faith in the banking system all at once. World leaders could rely on lessons gleaned from history to forge a plan: They flooded the markets with money and waited for calm to return.      But this time, as economic overseers confront a pandemic that has sent stock markets hurtling downward while provoking talk of a global recession, their tools appear impotent. The disaster feels eerily familiar, with trillions of dollars in wealth annihilated near-daily and deepening fears that businesses will fail. Yet the traditional policy prescriptions seem no match for the affliction at hand.      In many ways its far worse than 2008, said Joseph E. Stiglitz, the Nobel laureate economist. There was a sense that 2008 was a show that we had seen before  the panic of 1907, the Great Depression. We know about financial crises. We knew that it was just money, and that one way or the other the government would step in and save the bankers from their folly.      This time, Mr. Stiglitz added, the cause of the emergency is not bankers and their exotic and dangerous creations but the natural sphere  a less predictable realm. The fundamental threat to the global economy is the spread of the coronavirus. Yet the means of containing its spread entail worsening the economic pain by keeping workers home, limiting travel and disrupting commerce.   This is playing out as corporations are bearing historic levels of debt. A profound economic downturn could trigger a cascade of defaults. That could prompt creditors to pull back on lending, starving economies of capital.      Central banks appear largely ineffective in the face of this reality, while governments have been slow to deliver public money. Not least, investors fear a leadership vacuum. A global pandemic is unfolding, threatening life and livelihood on six continents, just as the world is roiled by an upsurge in nationalism, protectionism and a pushback to globalization. That appears to be hampering the response, reinforcing borders rather than inspiring coordinated action across them.      A sense of powerlessness is feeding the fear that is prompting investors to dump anything risky, which is in turn damaging economic prospects and reinforcing fear  a feedback loop.      This is a shock arising out of the real economy, out of the real world, out of biology, not out of financial shenanigans or complexities, said Adam S. Posen, a former member of the rate-setting committee at the Bank of England and now the president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. We are much less well suited to deal with this.      On Friday, world leaders were readying measures aimed at dispelling that impression. In Washington, the Trump administration and Congress neared agreement on a spending package to help workers and companies harmed by the pandemic. In Berlin, Chancellor Angela Merkel said Germany would set aside its longstanding aversion to debt while spending as needed to preserve public health and protect businesses.      But those actions  while a potentially crucial source of relief for people and businesses  cannot snuff out the basic threat to the world economy. Only the containment of the pandemic can achieve that. And that objective unavoidably involves worsening the economic straits in the immediate term.

Britain responded this week, unveiling a budget that included 30 billion pounds (about $38 billion) to address the pandemic. Italy has outlined plans to spend 25 billion euros (about $28 billion). The United States has so far found only $8.3 billion, though more is apparently on the way.      Europe has a history of crippling recriminations in the face of crisis. Within the 19 countries that share the euro currency, Germany has effectively stymied calls for more generous public spending, posing doubts about the follow-through on Ms. Merkels muscular promises.      China, the worst-hit country, is a much larger part of the world economy than a decade ago, yet increasingly limited by worries about its own mounting debts.      The most profound alarm may be the perception that the overseers of policy are not adequately committed to the challenge, especially the leader of the worlds largest economy, the United States.      President Trump initially portrayed the outbreak as a hoax perpetrated by his political enemies to damage him. His speech to the nation on Wednesday evening  during which he blamed a foreign virus for the pandemic and announced a severing of flights between the United States and Europe  resonated as a sign that he was managing the optics of the crisis rather than the crisis itself.      The markets have been yearning for evidence that higher powers will deploy unrestrained resources toward relief. What they have seen time and again is that the people in charge lack the appropriate resources for the job, or are unwilling to use them.      Economic historians may debate for centuries how policymakers in the United States and Europe responded to the global financial crisis  whether they were too generous to the bankers and too parsimonious to ordinary people; whether financial interests captured the regulators. But most take as a given that the governments in charge mounted a sincere effort to set things right  a stark contrast to the mood now.      The fact that financial markets went markedly into shock, Mr. Posen said, has to be attributed to a lack of confidence in policies and leadership. Its a failure of worldview. Bush and Obama believed in reality.      Conventional wisdom holds that the pandemic will be confined to the economic sphere, damaging livelihoods but falling short of triggering a financial crisis. The banks are in far stronger shape now, the logic goes, having been forced by chastened regulators to set aside reserves.      The crisis of 2008 forced economic policymakers to grapple with the interconnection of financial players around the world. The masters of money had taken mortgages and packaged them into exotic combinations, selling them to institutions that used them as collateral against other investments.      Only after home prices declined did the markets grasp the extent of the interlinkage. The assets were hard to value, and the liabilities were hidden in a tangle of unorthodox contracts. The markets froze in bewilderment and fright.      This time, the forces of decline are more conventional, limiting the scope for panic. Airlines are suffering along with hotels, cruise ships, and oil and gas companies. That is hurting stock prices and challenging their ability to pay back debts. But even if they go bust, markets will still function, with prices adjusting to the new realities.   This is a severe and temporary shock, said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Oslo. Things are going to improve in the second half of the year. It doesnt have to entail that we are in a downward spiral.      The biological origins of the crisis present a natural form of insurance that was not present when Wall Street wizards concocted unlimited quantities of financial derivatives. The natural arc of even the worst epidemics is that they are finite in duration, Mr. Posen said. When the worst of the epidemic is over, people will go back to normal.      But some argue that such depictions rest on excessive faith in the solidity of the financial system.      Banks retain creative powers to embellish their books by moving liabilities elsewhere.

His speech to the nation on Wednesday evening  during which he blamed a foreign virus for the pandemic and announced a severing of flights between the United States and Europe  resonated as a sign that he was managing the optics of the crisis rather than the crisis itself.      The markets have been yearning for evidence that higher powers will deploy unrestrained resources toward relief. What they have seen time and again is that the people in charge lack the appropriate resources for the job, or are unwilling to use them.      Economic historians may debate for centuries how policymakers in the United States and Europe responded to the global financial crisis  whether they were too generous to the bankers and too parsimonious to ordinary people; whether financial interests captured the regulators. But most take as a given that the governments in charge mounted a sincere effort to set things right  a stark contrast to the mood now.      The fact that financial markets went markedly into shock, Mr. Posen said, has to be attributed to a lack of confidence in policies and leadership. Its a failure of worldview. Bush and Obama believed in reality.      Conventional wisdom holds that the pandemic will be confined to the economic sphere, damaging livelihoods but falling short of triggering a financial crisis. The banks are in far stronger shape now, the logic goes, having been forced by chastened regulators to set aside reserves.      The crisis of 2008 forced economic policymakers to grapple with the interconnection of financial players around the world. The masters of money had taken mortgages and packaged them into exotic combinations, selling them to institutions that used them as collateral against other investments.      Only after home prices declined did the markets grasp the extent of the interlinkage. The assets were hard to value, and the liabilities were hidden in a tangle of unorthodox contracts. The markets froze in bewilderment and fright.      This time, the forces of decline are more conventional, limiting the scope for panic. Airlines are suffering along with hotels, cruise ships, and oil and gas companies. That is hurting stock prices and challenging their ability to pay back debts. But even if they go bust, markets will still function, with prices adjusting to the new realities.   This is a severe and temporary shock, said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Oslo. Things are going to improve in the second half of the year. It doesnt have to entail that we are in a downward spiral.      The biological origins of the crisis present a natural form of insurance that was not present when Wall Street wizards concocted unlimited quantities of financial derivatives. The natural arc of even the worst epidemics is that they are finite in duration, Mr. Posen said. When the worst of the epidemic is over, people will go back to normal.      But some argue that such depictions rest on excessive faith in the solidity of the financial system.      Banks retain creative powers to embellish their books by moving liabilities elsewhere. Balance sheet numbers look better, but they fool you, said Anat R. Admati, an economist at the Stanford Graduate School of Business      The ratings agencies that played a central role in the last crisis  affirming as wholesome the poisonous mortgages scattered around the earth  retain status as the official arbiters of risk.

BANGKOK  The faithful prayed by the thousands, hands and faces washed at communal taps to signify their purity. They crowded around platters on the floor, scooping up coconut rice with their right hands in the traditional way. And they slept in the mosque or in tents set up in the religious compound, rows of pilgrims from nearly 30 countries, gathered in Malaysia for spiritual renewal.      Three weeks later, participants in the 16,000-strong gathering of the worlds biggest Islamic missionary movement had spread the coronavirus to half a dozen nations, creating the largest known viral vector in Southeast Asia.      More than 620 people connected to the four-day conclave have tested positive in Malaysia, prompting the country to seal its borders until the end of the month. Most of the 73 coronavirus cases in Brunei are tied to the gathering, as are 10 cases in Thailand. At least two coronavirus deaths have been linked to the event.      We talked about religious concepts and our faith in God, not the coronavirus, said El Matly, a Cambodian seller of used phones who participated in the conclave.      After returning home, Mr. El Matly and 22 other Cambodian pilgrims tested positive.  Two of their wives are also sick.      The outbreak underscores how the pandemics momentum has moved beyond China, where the virus emerged. And it has thrown a spotlight on Tablighi Jamaat, a century-old missionary movement whose wandering bands of preachers depend on the charity of mosques to shelter them.      Known in parts of Southeast Asia as Jemaah Tabligh, Tablighi Jamaat is one of the largest faith-based movements in the world, according to the Pew Research Center, and it counts politically influential people among its followers.      The groups message: Return to the way life was during the time of the Prophet Muhammad. Dress the same way, pray the same way. Some even advocate using wooden sticks as toothbrushes. At conclaves attended by thousands of people, Tablighi Jamaats adherents pray and eat together in mosques.   ImageA Tablighi Jamaat gathering in Tongi, Bangladesh, in 2017.

South Koreas outbreak, which for weeks was the worst outside China, originated from a secretive sect called the Shincheonji Church of Jesus. Thousands of the churchs followers and people who came into contact with them have tested positive.      As worldwide toll reaches 10,000, medical workers issue urgent pleas for assistance.

See more updates   More live coverage: Markets U.S. New York   Two of the biggest viral clusters in Singapore have been connected to churches. Pilgrims returning from the holy city of Qom in Iran have spread the virus through Central and South Asia.      And despite government warnings about the danger of convening large groups of people during a pandemic, mass religious assemblies are continuing. India is urging Hindu pilgrims not to come to the state of Uttar Pradesh next week for a nine-day celebration that hundreds of thousands had planned to attend.      Even as coronavirus cases from its Malaysia gathering surged, Tablighi Jamaat had been planning another multiday event on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, which was set to begin on Thursday and run through this weekend.      After a public outcry, the Indonesian presidential spokesman announced that the Sulawesi meeting was off, on the very morning it was to begin. But nearly 8,700 worshipers from 10 countries had already congregated in the town of Gowa, crowding into tents and sharing food, just like in Malaysia.      None of us have a fear of corona, said one of them, Roni Arif, the head of a community health center in Mamuju, Sulawesi. We are afraid of God.      On March 2, Indonesia, the worlds fourth most populous nation, had only two confirmed coronavirus cases. As of Friday, that figure had risen to 369, with 32 deaths. A cabinet minister is among those who have tested positive.      All sickness and all health is from God, said Mr. Roni, who is employed on the local level by the ministry of health. Whatever happens to us is Gods will.   Image   Tablighi Jamaat devotees in Pakistan in 2009. The group calls for returning to the way life was lived in the Prophet Muhammads time.

Credit...Tyler HicksThe New York Times   Founded by an Islamic scholar in India in the 1920s, Tablighi Jamaat is tight-lipped about its membership, but high-ranking politicians and their relatives have been linked to the group. The son of Indonesias defense minister was a member. Western governments have tied Tablighi Jamaat to the recruitment of militants, accusations its followers deny.      Mr. El Matly, the Cambodian who contracted the coronavirus in Malaysia, said he had attended Tablighi events across Southeast Asia.      I can afford it, and I think its good if I spend my money on religion, he said.      At the Malaysian assembly, Mr. El Matly slept in the main prayer hall, where rows of mats were placed about a foot and a half apart, he said. Others sheltered in tents that could hold up to 200 people.      There was no announcement on virus protection, he said. I would not have gone if I had known there was a virus there.   The Tablighi conclave in multiethnic Malaysia took place as the country was locked in a political showdown between a reformist, multiracial bloc and a conservative faction looking to increase the power of Malay Muslims. By the final day of the Tablighi gathering, a new prime minister had been sworn in, backed by a coalition including an Islamic party that has campaigned to turn Malaysia into an Islamic state.      As Malaysian health officials tried to track the spread of the coronavirus through the region, others in the political establishment were preoccupied with the unfolding leadership crisis. Tablighi participants were getting sick, but members of the new Malaysian government focused on damage control.      The likelihood of dying from the coronavirus is only 1 percent, while the possibility of dying at any moment is 100 percent, wrote Siti Zailah Mohd Yusoff, the deputy minister for women and family development, on Twitter.      The health ministry initially said that 5,000 Malaysians had attended the Tablighi conference. Days later, the number was revised to about 14,500 Malaysians and 1,500 foreigners.      Among the devotees were hundreds of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, who had escaped persecution back home for lives as undocumented workers in Malaysia. Locating them is proving to be difficult.      With its viral caseload proliferating in the wake of the Tablighi gathering, Malaysia on Wednesday closed its borders to nearly all travelers until March 31. With rare exceptions, no Malaysians are allowed to leave the country and no foreigners are allowed to enter. Only essential businesses can stay open. Mosques are closed for Friday prayers.      On Thursday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the 83 Malaysians who had gone to Indonesia for the Tablighi event there would be allowed to come home and would be screened for the coronavirus.   Tablighi followers had been streaming into Gowa, the town where the Indonesian gathering was to take place, for days. The abrupt cancellation has left many of them stranded.      Nurdin Abdullah, the governor of South Sulawesi, said that all foreigners who had gathered in Gowa would be isolated in a hotel and escorted to the airport. In the meantime, Indonesians were still passing the time in tents on Thursday, reading religious texts and discussing theology with scholars.      Its not reckless for us to have come here and gathered in big groups, said Ilman Murgan, a farmer. Its important for us to learn how to draw ourselves closer to God.      On Thursday, another religious assembly, this one involving Catholics, took place on the island of Flores, further east in Indonesia. About 2,000 people, including nuns in starched habits, squeezed into a church to celebrate the ordination of a bishop.      The Indonesian minister of information had flown in to join the celebration. But he left after the National Disaster Mitigation Agency advised on Thursday morning that it, like other large social gatherings, should be canceled. The cardinal went ahead with the event.      Hans Jeharut, a priest who attended the four-hour ordination, said that at least 30 bishops were among the congregants. Participants temperatures were taken twice. There had been no bishop in the area for more than two years, Mr. Jeharut said, and canceling the celebration would have disappointed the diocese.      The peoples euphoria has to be understood, he said. Yes, this was a celebration. But it was a celebration of faith.",t3_fltsrc,Coronavirus,1.0,2020-03-20,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,"a gathering of 16,000 at a malaysian mosque became the pandemics largest known vector in southeast asia, spreading the coronavirus to half a dozen countries. bangkok the faithful prayed by the thousands, hands and faces washed at communal taps to signify their purity. they crowded around platters on the floor, scooping up coconut rice with their right hands in the traditional way. and they slept in the mosque or in tents set up in the religious compound, rows of pilgrims from nearly 30 countries, gathered in malaysia for spiritual renewal. three weeks later, participants in the 16,000 strong gathering of the worlds biggest islamic missionary movement had spread the coronavirus to half a dozen nations, creating the largest known viral vector in southeast asia. more than 620 people connected to the four day conclave have tested positive in malaysia, prompting the country to seal its borders until the end of the month. most of the 73 coronavirus cases in brunei are tied to the gathering, as are 10 cases in thailand. at least two coronavirus deaths have been linked to the event. we talked about religious concepts and our faith in god, not the coronavirus, said el matly, a cambodian seller of used phones who participated in the conclave. after returning home, mr. el matly and 22 other cambodian pilgrims tested positive. two of their wives are also sick. the outbreak underscores how the pandemics momentum has moved beyond china, where the virus emerged. and it has thrown a spotlight on tablighi jamaat, a century old missionary movement whose wandering bands of preachers depend on the charity of mosques to shelter them. known in parts of southeast asia as jemaah tabligh, tablighi jamaat is one of the largest faith based movements in the world, according to the pew research center, and it counts politically influential people among its followers. the groups message return to the way life was during the time of the prophet muhammad.",-1.4660477230718894,-1.4660477230718894,12.0,421.0,2.0,2.5161290322580645,M,41.63609108967412,93,0.3,0.4116118028623271,0.8784585919193317,1.2809799907487232,0.6109598099719177,2.647492509878309,1.9007638532459656,8.51949512794174,0,"{'VB': 0, 'VBD': 0, 'VBG': 0, 'VBN': 0, 'VBP': 0, 'VBZ': 0}",0,Comments,0.5992700361152675,1957,10.759681097838774,4.0730653998127835,0.8146130799625568,1,876,3,5,0,1,fl0gpdh_p0,1_and_the_same_1,0.5006090442043994,0

India is urging Hindu pilgrims not to come to the state of Uttar Pradesh next week for a nine-day celebration that hundreds of thousands had planned to attend.      Even as coronavirus cases from its Malaysia gathering surged, Tablighi Jamaat had been planning another multiday event on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, which was set to begin on Thursday and run through this weekend.      After a public outcry, the Indonesian presidential spokesman announced that the Sulawesi meeting was off, on the very morning it was to begin. But nearly 8,700 worshipers from 10 countries had already congregated in the town of Gowa, crowding into tents and sharing food, just like in Malaysia.

The son of Indonesias defense minister was a member. Western governments have tied Tablighi Jamaat to the recruitment of militants, accusations its followers deny.      Mr. El Matly, the Cambodian who contracted the coronavirus in Malaysia, said he had attended Tablighi events across Southeast Asia.      I can afford it, and I think its good if I spend my money on religion, he said.      At the Malaysian assembly, Mr. El Matly slept in the main prayer hall, where rows of mats were placed about a foot and a half apart, he said. Others sheltered in tents that could hold up to 200 people.      There was no announcement on virus protection, he said. I would not have gone if I had known there was a virus there.   The Tablighi conclave in multiethnic Malaysia took place as the country was locked in a political showdown between a reformist, multiracial bloc and a conservative faction looking to increase the power of Malay Muslims. By the final day of the Tablighi gathering, a new prime minister had been sworn in, backed by a coalition including an Islamic party that has campaigned to turn Malaysia into an Islamic state.      As Malaysian health officials tried to track the spread of the coronavirus through the region, others in the political establishment were preoccupied with the unfolding leadership crisis. Tablighi participants were getting sick, but members of the new Malaysian government focused on damage control.      The likelihood of dying from the coronavirus is only 1 percent, while the possibility of dying at any moment is 100 percent, wrote Siti Zailah Mohd Yusoff, the deputy minister for women and family development, on Twitter.      The health ministry initially said that 5,000 Malaysians had attended the Tablighi conference. Days later, the number was revised to about 14,500 Malaysians and 1,500 foreigners.      Among the devotees were hundreds of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, who had escaped persecution back home for lives as undocumented workers in Malaysia. Locating them is proving to be difficult.      With its viral caseload proliferating in the wake of the Tablighi gathering, Malaysia on Wednesday closed its borders to nearly all travelers until March 31. With rare exceptions, no Malaysians are allowed to leave the country and no foreigners are allowed to enter. Only essential businesses can stay open. Mosques are closed for Friday prayers.      On Thursday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the 83 Malaysians who had gone to Indonesia for the Tablighi event there would be allowed to come home and would be screened for the coronavirus.   Tablighi followers had been streaming into Gowa, the town where the Indonesian gathering was to take place, for days. The abrupt cancellation has left many of them stranded.      Nurdin Abdullah, the governor of South Sulawesi, said that all foreigners who had gathered in Gowa would be isolated in a hotel and escorted to the airport. In the meantime, Indonesians were still passing the time in tents on Thursday, reading religious texts and discussing theology with scholars.      Its not reckless for us to have come here and gathered in big groups, said Ilman Murgan, a farmer. Its important for us to learn how to draw ourselves closer to God.      On Thursday, another religious assembly, this one involving Catholics, took place on the island of Flores, further east in Indonesia. About 2,000 people, including nuns in starched habits, squeezed into a church to celebrate the ordination of a bishop.      The Indonesian minister of information had flown in to join the celebration. But he left after the National Disaster Mitigation Agency advised on Thursday morning that it, like other large social gatherings, should be canceled. The cardinal went ahead with the event.      Hans Jeharut, a priest who attended the four-hour ordination, said that at least 30 bishops were among the congregants. Participants temperatures were taken twice. There had been no bishop in the area for more than two years, Mr. Jeharut said, and canceling the celebration would have disappointed the diocese.

They crowded around platters on the floor, scooping up coconut rice with their right hands in the traditional way. And they slept in the mosque or in tents set up in the religious compound, rows of pilgrims from nearly 30 countries, gathered in Malaysia for spiritual renewal.      Three weeks later, participants in the 16,000-strong gathering of the worlds biggest Islamic missionary movement had spread the coronavirus to half a dozen nations, creating the largest known viral vector in Southeast Asia.      More than 620 people connected to the four-day conclave have tested positive in Malaysia, prompting the country to seal its borders until the end of the month. Most of the 73 coronavirus cases in Brunei are tied to the gathering, as are 10 cases in Thailand. At least two coronavirus deaths have been linked to the event.      We talked about religious concepts and our faith in God, not the coronavirus, said El Matly, a Cambodian seller of used phones who participated in the conclave.

They crowded around platters on the floor, scooping up coconut rice with their right hands in the traditional way. And they slept in the mosque or in tents set up in the religious compound, rows of pilgrims from nearly 30 countries, gathered in Malaysia for spiritual renewal.      Three weeks later, participants in the 16,000-strong gathering of the worlds biggest Islamic missionary movement had spread the coronavirus to half a dozen nations, creating the largest known viral vector in Southeast Asia.      More than 620 people connected to the four-day conclave have tested positive in Malaysia, prompting the country to seal its borders until the end of the month. Most of the 73 coronavirus cases in Brunei are tied to the gathering, as are 10 cases in Thailand. At least two coronavirus deaths have been linked to the event.      We talked about religious concepts and our faith in God, not the coronavirus, said El Matly, a Cambodian seller of used phones who participated in the conclave.      After returning home, Mr. El Matly and 22 other Cambodian pilgrims tested positive.  Two of their wives are also sick.      The outbreak underscores how the pandemics momentum has moved beyond China, where the virus emerged. And it has thrown a spotlight on Tablighi Jamaat, a century-old missionary movement whose wandering bands of preachers depend on the charity of mosques to shelter them.      Known in parts of Southeast Asia as Jemaah Tabligh, Tablighi Jamaat is one of the largest faith-based movements in the world, according to the Pew Research Center, and it counts politically influential people among its followers.

Even as coronavirus cases from its Malaysia gathering surged, Tablighi Jamaat had been planning another multiday event on the island of Sulawesi in Indonesia, which was set to begin on Thursday and run through this weekend.      After a public outcry, the Indonesian presidential spokesman announced that the Sulawesi meeting was off, on the very morning it was to begin. But nearly 8,700 worshipers from 10 countries had already congregated in the town of Gowa, crowding into tents and sharing food, just like in Malaysia.

The likelihood of dying from the coronavirus is only 1 percent, while the possibility of dying at any moment is 100 percent, wrote Siti Zailah Mohd Yusoff, the deputy minister for women and family development, on Twitter.      The health ministry initially said that 5,000 Malaysians had attended the Tablighi conference. Days later, the number was revised to about 14,500 Malaysians and 1,500 foreigners.      Among the devotees were hundreds of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, who had escaped persecution back home for lives as undocumented workers in Malaysia. Locating them is proving to be difficult.      With its viral caseload proliferating in the wake of the Tablighi gathering, Malaysia on Wednesday closed its borders to nearly all travelers until March 31. With rare exceptions, no Malaysians are allowed to leave the country and no foreigners are allowed to enter. Only essential businesses can stay open. Mosques are closed for Friday prayers.      On Thursday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the 83 Malaysians who had gone to Indonesia for the Tablighi event there would be allowed to come home and would be screened for the coronavirus.   Tablighi followers had been streaming into Gowa, the town where the Indonesian gathering was to take place, for days. The abrupt cancellation has left many of them stranded.      Nurdin Abdullah, the governor of South Sulawesi, said that all foreigners who had gathered in Gowa would be isolated in a hotel and escorted to the airport. In the meantime, Indonesians were still passing the time in tents on Thursday, reading religious texts and discussing theology with scholars.      Its not reckless for us to have come here and gathered in big groups, said Ilman Murgan, a farmer. Its important for us to learn how to draw ourselves closer to God.
